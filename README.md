# react-word

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts to run

After cloning the repo, run the following commands in order:

    ```
    yarn run release
    yarn start
    ```

This should open up a local host browser with the react project.

## Used Packages

### React-Bootstrap

Bootstrap version of React. Used the 'dropdownMenu' and grid system.

### Recharts

Used for portraying the graph for the words that is most compatible with react (as far as I know)

### Font Awesome

Used for arraw and cog icons. The latest update of bootstrap got rid of glyphicons so Font Awesome is used in place of them.
